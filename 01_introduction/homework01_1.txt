a)	The columns that would need to be changed are the Course_number columns in the COURSE, SECTION, and 
PREREQUISITE tables, as well as the Major column in the STUDENT table, the Department column in the
COURSE table, and the Prerequisite_number column in the PREREQUISITE table. 
b)	It's not possible to only change one field. At the very least, you'd need to have both the COURSE and
the PREREQUISITE tables in order to keep track of more than one prerequisite per course. As both those tables
need the Course_number column, you'd have to change it in both tables.
